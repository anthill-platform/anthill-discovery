## Multiple networks
Often services need to use internal routes to communicate with other services for security reasons.
That's why discovery service has multiple networks defined: `external` and `internal`. 
The `external` network is used by end users, and available online from the web.

On the other hand, the `internal` network is only accessible from inside of the Anthill Platform.
Often, services give more privileges for internal requests. 
Some requests can only be called from the inside.
Even the `internal` location of a service can be discovered only from the inside.

Each service has a list of IP addresses, request from who is considered to be internal, usually it's a
local subnet, like `10.0.0.0/24`.
